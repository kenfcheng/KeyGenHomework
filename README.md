This assignment has been an up and down scenario.  I would have loved to have seen it come together, but I can't seem to get it to work.  I spent a bunch of hours on this and there were times I thought I was getting somewhere only to be stonewalled at certain points.

A lot of my work in this is definitely influenced by stuff I read online and other resources I was able to find, which can be shown in my attempted design.  Orignally, I didn't plan on using slider bars and check boxes, and tried to follow the prompt pages like I think was expected.  However, after countless hours on that, it was apparent I wasn't getting anywhere with that, so I decided to try to use the same techniques I was self-learning from outside resources and tutorials.

In a way I thought this would be comperable as it does do what the prompts asks, but in a more condensed way.

I thought I was making good progress this way, but now it's at the end and something isn't quite working and I'm not sure what else to do.
